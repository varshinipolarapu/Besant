LinkedIn Scraper

Project Summary

This mini project is a **Java-based web scraper** that automates the process of extracting names from LinkedIn search results using **Selenium WebDriver**. It simulates browser actions to log in,navigate through paginated search results, and extract profile names.

The extracted data is stored in a **CSV file** (`output.csv`) for easy review and further use, such as lead generation or research (as per LinkedIn's usage policy).
